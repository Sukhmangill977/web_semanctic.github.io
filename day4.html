                Example of Swiggy <br>
                how it works   1 peson oders the food <br>
                1 person makes the food the person making does not know the one ordering and the ordering one does not know the cook simillar the the delivery guy is unfimillar with the both persons 
                -all of 3 are in  relationships <br>
                <br>
                -simillary thousands of relationships are formed <br>
                <br>
                RDF - triple  ( form of graph) <br>
                a general framework for representing interconnected data on the web<br>
                <br>
                RDF statements are used for describing and exchanging metadata, which enables standardized exchange of data based on relationships. RDF is used to integrate data from multiple sources.<br>
                <br>
                why are we studing RDF ?<br>
                It’s fast efficent so we are studying it <br>

                Meta data exchange ( most imp) exchange data with user and internet
                <br><br>( judging the behaviour to user )
                <br>Every page have different meta’s(like a website shows different options for everyone based on their search need and wants -which are identified based on history search 
                <br><br><br>
                
                semantic metadata is the description of the meanings of values and of the names of data components, at least for human reference and possibly for programmatic use as well.
                <br><br><br>
                
                <br>Subject -  The subject is typically a resource or concept,
                <br>Object  -  he object is the value of the predicate
                <br>Predicate -  the predicate is a property or attribute of the subject (make relationships between subject and object )

                Linked  data -  is one of the core pillars of the Semantic Web, also known as the Web of Data. The Semantic Web is about making links between datasets that are understandable not only to humans, but also to machines, and Linked Data provides the best practices for making these links possible
                <br><br>
                
                FOAF (Friend of a Friend) is an RDF (Resource Description Framework) vocabulary used to describe people, their activities, and their relationships to other people and objects. It is designed to be used by computers to make connections between data on the web.

                How json and xml data is formed -
                <br><br>
                JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) are two formats commonly used to structure and transfer data. Here's a breakdown of how data is formed in each format:
                <br><br>
                Readability: JSON is generally considered more readable and concise compared to XML.<br>
                Data Types: JSON supports basic data types (strings, numbers, arrays, objects, booleans, null) natively. XML data is represented as text, and data types need to be interpreted.<br>
                Structure: JSON is more compact with its key/value pair structure, whereas XML’s nested elements can result in more verbose data.<br>
                Usage: JSON is widely used in web APIs and configuration files, while XML is often used in document formats, configuration files, and in applications where complex data representation is necessary.<br>
