        there Standard used to represent relationships with data and web 
        
        lets take a 
        Example of Swiggy 
        how it works   1 peson oders the food 
        1 person makes the food the person making does not know the one ordering and the ordering one does not know the cook simillar the the delivery guy is unfimillar with the both persons 
        ﻿all of 3 are in  relationships 
        ﻿
        ﻿simillary thousands of relationships are formed 
        
        RDF - triple  ( form of graph) 
        a general framework for representing interconnected data on the web
        
        RDF statements are used for describing and exchanging metadata, which enables standardized exchange of data based on relationships. RDF is used to integrate data from multiple sources.
        
        why are we studing RDF ?
        It’s fast efficent so we are studying it

        Triple - means 
        subject 
        Predicate 
        Object 
        
        
        Meta data exchange ( most imp) exchange data with user and internet
         ( judging the behaviour to user )
        Every page have different meta’s(like a website shows different options for everyone based on their search need and wants -which are identified based on history search 
        
        
        semantic metadata is the description of the meanings of values and of the names of data components, at least for human reference and possibly for programmatic use as well.
        
        
        Subject   The subject is typically a resource or concept,
        Object    he object is the value of the predicate
        Predicate.  the predicate is a property or attribute of the subject (make relationships between subject and object )

        Linked  data -  is one of the core pillars of the Semantic Web, also known as the Web of Data. The Semantic Web is about making links between datasets that are understandable not only to humans, but also to machines, and Linked Data provides the best practices for making these links possible
        
        
        FOAF (Friend of a Friend) is an RDF (Resource Description Framework) vocabulary used to describe people, their activities, and their relationships to other people and objects. It is designed to be used by computers to make connections between data on the web.
        
        
        How json and xml data is formed -
        
        JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) are two formats commonly used to structure and transfer data. Here's a breakdown of how data is formed in each format:
        
        Readability: JSON is generally considered more readable and concise compared to XML.
        Data Types: JSON supports basic data types (strings, numbers, arrays, objects, booleans, null) natively. XML data is represented as text, and data types need to be interpreted.
        Structure: JSON is more compact with its key/value pair structure, whereas XML’s nested elements can result in more verbose data.
        Usage: JSON is widely used in web APIs and configuration files, while XML is often used in document formats, configuration files, and in applications where complex data representation is necessary.\
