        What is web semantic ?
        
        What is semantic?
        
        Why do we need it?
        
        Semantic word meaning - describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. 
        
        
        web semantic -a web that is able to describe things in a way that computers can. Describing things in a way that computers applications can understand is what the Semantic Web is all about.
        
        
        Need-aims to enrich the Web with a layer of machine-interpretable metadata so that computer programs can predictably derive new information.

        1. See Header div id header 
        But acc to semantic  html standard it is wrong

        Search engine optimisation-
        
        
        is the process used to optimize a website's technical configuration, content relevance and link popularity so its pages can become easily findable, more relevant and popular towards user search queries, and as a consequence, search engines rank them better.
