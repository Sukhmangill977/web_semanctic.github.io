        What is web semantic ?<br>
        
        What is semantic?<br>
        
        Why do we need it?<br>
        
        Semantic word meaning - describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. <br><br>
        
        
        web semantic -a web that is able to describe things in a way that computers can. Describing things in a way that computers applications can understand is what the Semantic Web is all about.<br><br>
        
        
        Need-aims to enrich the Web with a layer of machine-interpretable metadata so that computer programs can predictably derive new information.<br>

        <br>
        So we use semantic web <br>
